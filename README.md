# WebAssembly (Wasm) Container Image Playground

Welcome to the WebAssembly (Wasm) Container Image Playground! This project serves as a comprehensive sandbox for developers to explore, learn, and experiment with creating containerized applications using Wasm images. Our repository contains a range of Rust applications and Dockerfiles, compiled into Wasm and packaged into container images.

WebAssembly is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine that provides developers with a fast, efficient, and portable target for compilation. By packaging applications into Wasm container images, developers can deploy their applications across various systems with ease and efficiency.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the playground, you'll need a few tools in your developer toolkit:

1. **Rust**: The Rust language is central to our sample applications in the repository. Rust offers memory safety without a garbage collector, making it a prime candidate for WebAssembly applications. Install it from [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
2. **Docker/Podman**: These are necessary for working with and managing container images. Docker can be installed from [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/), while Podman instructions can be found [here](https://podman.io/getting-started/installation).

## Contents

This repository contains several sample applications, each accompanied by a Dockerfile. These samples are designed to guide you through the process of compiling Rust into Wasm, packing it into a container image, and deploying it. Feel free to explore, modify, and use these examples as a basis for your own projects.

## Getting Started

To get started:

1. **Clone the repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine to begin exploring.
2. **Explore the Applications**: Navigate through the repository and explore the variety of applications available. Each application is placed in a separate folder and is accompanied by its Dockerfile.
3. **Build and Deploy**: Follow the individual README files in each application folder for instructions on how to build and deploy each container image.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to the Wasm Container Image Playground! Whether you're fixing bugs, improving the documentation, or proposing new sample applications, your contributions are greatly appreciated.
